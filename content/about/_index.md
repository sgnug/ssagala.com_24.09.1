## Work

I currently work as a Media Producer at [Red Clay Ltd](https://redclay.ug), with my main focus being the Sawasawa Project. 

Sawasawa is an entertainment and educational project that aims to create and distribute locally-made media to young adults in East Africa. We strongly believe that African stories should dominate African screens, and we work towards achieving that goal every day. 

I also dabble in real estate and securities investing. I am very much stillma beginner in both.  
   

## Some random facts about me

- I spend my days creating and producing: words, music, videos and custom projects for clients. 
- I love reading. Physical books > tablets.
- I also love television, movies and the internet. 
- I used to DJ and to host a weekly new music radio show as Mister Deejay.
- I have done some work in front of camera, but I find my true place is behind the scenes. 
- I am an occasional Wordpress Wrangler and know just enough about software to get myself into trouble.
- I am happily married to a fantastic woman who is also the love of my life, and I consider myself very lucky in that regard. 
- I have a daughter, and being her dad is one of my most cherised roles.
