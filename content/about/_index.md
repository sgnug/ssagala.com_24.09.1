Iâ€™m Ssagala Godfrey Ndugwa.

## Work

I am a media producer at [Red Clay Ltd](https://redclay.ug) and with the Sawasawa Project - an entertainment and educational channel that creates and distributes locally-made media to young adults in East Africa. 
   

## Some random facts about me

- I spend my days creating and maintaining things. Mainly words, music and videos. 
- I have done some work in front of camera/mic/, but I my real happy place is behind the scenes. 
- I am an occasional Wordpress Wrangler and know just enough about software to get myself into trouble.
- I once worked as a radio DJ and tv presenter under the name Mister Deejay. (I'm obviously an excellent name-chooser)
- I love reading. Physical books over tablets, and audiobooks count. 
- I also love television, movies and the internet. 
- I am happily married to a fantastic woman, the absolute love of my life.
- I have a wonderful daughter, who is my limitless source of joy.

Those last two facts in particular make me a happy, content, grateful individual.
